This week's puzzle is about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.

King Arthur has hired a consultant, Sir Cumference, to plan a seating arrangement for Arthur and nine of his knights to sit around the round table.

This would not be a difficult task, were it not for the jealousies and petty rivalries that exist among the knights:

- Arthur insists that Lancelot should sit on his right and that Kay should occupy the seat on Arthur's left
- Bedivere refuses to sit next to anyone but Lionel and Tristan
- Gawain won't sit next to Tristan, Lancelot, or Lionel
- Gareth won't sit next to Galahad, Lancelot, or Kay
- Perceval objects to sitting next to Galahad, Lancelot, or, Lionel
- Tristan refuses to sit next to Lancelot, Perceval, or Kay
- Galahad will sit next to anyone except Gawain and Kay
- Lionel will not sit next to Galahad
- The other two knights are not particular about whom they sit next to

Help Sir Cumference find a suitable seating arrangement.
